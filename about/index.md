In the mid-70s, a few individuals took an initiative to try and bring together people from Shiraha living in Nairobi, and eventually form a Shiraha Welfare Society. These individuals included, among others, Achwang'a wa Akhome, Anywa wa Gadi, Cleopas Atanda we Lihoywa, Esala we Lihoywa, James Musita we Lihoywa, Eshiachili wa Sechieli, Naaman Manyasa, Charles Manyasa, Joseph Omusula Abuko - Treasurer, Fred Andayi Akolo and Evans Arthur Mukolwe. Because most of these people were residents of Mathare Valley, many meetings took place in Mathare Valley.


The main focus of this group was funerals, expenses involved in delivering home bodies of those who passed away. Inevitably, this called for financial contributions which, unfortunately, became the killer blow to the very existence of that very group. People contributed at most one shilling and only at meetings, there were no contributions at any other times. Eventually, the treasurer disappeared with close to Kshs 39 that had been collected over a two year period and the initiative died with it.
This is not to say that there were no other initiatives. Initiatives may have been there for various other reasons and at different times, but they were not highlighted and/or many of us were not aware of their existence.


There is, therefore, a distortion of facts in as far as the current Shiraha Welfare Society is concerned. On the afternoon, of 20th December 1981, Fred Andayi Akolo, Evans Arthur Mukolwe and James Khachula Opindi sat in Ngong' Hills Hotel along Ngong' Road in Nairobi and came up with the idea of forming and establishing a Shiraha Welfare Society. It was clear then that if there were any other groupings, they were dysfunctional. Joseph Omachi Musaa was immediately incorporated and, a little later, the late Adams Mang'ula joined the group. The group appointed Fred Andayi Akolo as Chairman, Evans Arthur Mukolwe as Secretary and Joseph Omachi Musaa as treasurer. It was agreed then that each member of the Society would contribute Kshs 100 per month, thereby creating the famous account number 1850 in Standard Chartered Bank.


Great effort was then made to reach possible members of the new Society. Fred Andayi Akolo, Evans Arthur Mukolwe and James Khachula Opindi hit the road and visited various Nairobi estates in an effort to convince Shiraha people to join the Society.
The Society aimed to create relevance for the Shiraha Nairobi Community with the home community, assist members in times of difficulties, locate each other’s residences and enable members’ children know each other, among other aims.
The first meeting and the subsequent ones were held at Ngong' Hills Hotel until the group was branded elitist by many potential members. It was then decided that meetings would be hosted by members in their houses on a rotational basis once every month.
The baby has come of age, we thank the Almighty God!!
