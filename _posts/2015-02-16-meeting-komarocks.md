Well from Caltex on Outering Road Kangundo Junction, you drive about 3.5Km and turn right opposite the Double M yard and turn right immediate at the junction to Kanguru road. Drive straight on through the Komarock Ph. 4 gate and about 300 M from the gate and turn right again to ACACIA court immediately after the By-Grace Academy. Drive straight on through WAKOS Court to house 1253.
