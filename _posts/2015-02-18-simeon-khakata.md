title: Passing on of Simeon Khakata's child
---
My condolences to the family of Simeon Khakata for the loss of the second born child. It only three weeks ago the family visited me. I talked to them and encouraged him to find time and join us in welfare. Little did I know this misfortune would befall him. Loss of a family member is devastating and everyone requires encouragement. We are sincerely sorry for the loss and pray for Godâ€™s love, and strength at this moment.

I have tried to reach Simeon Khakata without success on several occasions. I have been talking to his brother Franco severally as well. It is better that when we find ourselves in a difficult or sorrowful situation, we open up and communicate to encourage each other. We live for each other and Gods love upon us all

wow
