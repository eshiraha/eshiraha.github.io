--- 
I am sure each one of us is aware of the misfortune that has beffalen us. Just as a reminder, Mr. Walter Akolo lost his dear wife Janet over the weekend. It is so tragic and hard to come to terms with. Many of you have shared messages of condolences with the family.

The purpose of this email is to inform you that for planning purposes, there will be meetings every evening starting 7:00pm at Walter's residence in Court Rajet / Ngutu House 834 Buruburu. The meetings started yesterday and I encourage all of us to be attending these meetings. I will be providing updates on email on a daily basis.

On bahalf of the entire Shiraha Welfare fraternity, let me convey our condolences to Walter and family.

Ambenje, Peter
